## About Me
<p>
I am a designer who loves cakes🍰, pastries🧁 and tea☕.<br>
I also do a bit of coding and front-end work🖥⌨<br>

My main work is UI with human-centred design, UX development and consultancy.<br>
My motto is 'Have fun, enjoy and make life better👍'.<br>
I am not over-enthusiastic and like to take things as they come, but I am also a worrier.<br><br>

My hobbies are watching football and learning languages.<br>
I am a worrier, but a warrior a football enthusiast. <br>
I love to eat🍕🍜🍣<br>
